# Marketplace Project ‚Äì Java Desktop Application

## 1. Introduction
The **Marketplace Project** is a Java-based desktop application designed to simulate an online marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact to trade goods and services.  
The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling users to perform various e-commerce functions such as product listing, purchasing, and order management.  
It demonstrates skills in **object-oriented programming, JavaFX, database integration, and desktop application design**.

---

## 2. Project Objectives
- Develop a functional desktop e-commerce application.
- Enable management of users, products, and categories.
- Implement a role-based architecture: **Admin** and **Client**.
- Demonstrate JavaFX integration with a MySQL database.

---

## 3. Project Architecture
The application follows a simple **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture:  
- **Model**: classes representing entities (User, Product, Category, Order).  
- **View**: JavaFX interfaces (Login, Admin Dashboard, Client Dashboard, etc.).  
- **Controller**: handles events and interacts with the database via JDBC.
